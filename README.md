# The Gaming Room Software Design Documentation  

## Summary of the Client and Software Requirements  
The Gaming Room is our client, a company that wanted us to design a software application for their multiplayer trivia game. They needed a solution that would allow players to connect and play across multiple platforms seamlessly while maintaining high performance and scalability.  

## Highlights of My Work  
One area I’m particularly proud of is how clearly and thoroughly I documented the design process. I focused on making sure everything—from the system architecture to the technical details—was easy to follow and aligned with the client’s goals.  

## Insights Gained from the Design Process  
Working through the design document was incredibly helpful when developing the code. It gave me a clear roadmap and forced me to think through potential challenges before they became roadblocks. This structure saved time and made coding smoother.  

## Room for Improvement  
If I could go back and revise one part, it would be the user interface section of the documentation. I’d spend more time creating detailed mockups or wireframes to better communicate the layout and flow of the application to the client and development team.  

## Addressing the User’s Needs  
I interpreted the user’s needs by reviewing their requirements carefully and mapping them to specific features in the software. Considering the user’s perspective is essential because it ensures the application solves their problems effectively and provides a great user experience.  

## Approach to Software Design  
My approach to designing the software started with breaking down the client’s requirements into functional and non-functional needs. From there, I created diagrams and workflows to visualize the system. In the future, I would use strategies like prototyping or more frequent client feedback sessions to refine designs earlier in the process.
